# Willems Soft games

The Delphi source code for the little games i wrote when i was a child.
The binaries and setup files are still available on my [website](http://www.willemssoft.be/index.php?main=5&sub=7&page=1&changeview=1&show=10) but here is the source code.

The code is mostly unmodified, i just removed a TWebLabel component on certain forms. The code is also badly written / formatted as can be expected when a kid was learning to program. The code was initially written with very old delphi versions, but it compiles fine with the latest delphi tokyo starter edition, which is free.

Certain things like the old .hlp help files might not work anymore on certain windows versions

I do not own all source code anymore some of the code had been lost a very long time ago due to hard disk failure but i'll try to upload any (delphi) game code i still might have

I made this code available for educational purposes, maybe someone has some use for it.
